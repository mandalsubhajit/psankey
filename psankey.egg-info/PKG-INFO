        # psankey - A module for plotting Sankey flow diagrams in Python
        
        Inspired by **d3-sankey** package for d3js (https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey)
        
        ## Brief description
        
        In data science, we often require to visualize flows in the form of a Sankey diagram. This module helps with that. Usage is very straightforward and customizable.
        
        **Note:** Does not work for cyclical graphs.
        
        ## Getting started
